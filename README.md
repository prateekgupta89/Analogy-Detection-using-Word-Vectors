# Analogy-Detection-using-Word-Vectors
This assignment shows how to use word vectors to find analogy relations and how to debias word embeddings to reduce gender bias.
This assignment uses following steps:
1) Load pre-trained word vectors, and measure similarity using cosine similarity2) Use word embeddings to solve word analogy problems such as Man is to Woman as King is to __.
3) Modify word embeddings to reduce their gender bias using Boliukbasi et al., 2016
